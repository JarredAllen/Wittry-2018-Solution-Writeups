# Write-Ups to the Wittry 2018 Competition
The Wittry competition is an annual computer programming competition hosted at Troy High School. Within this repository are solutions to all of the problems at the 2018 version of the competition, as well as some testers.

## Who is this for?
These write-ups are targeted at students who wish to not only compete and do well in the Wittry competition and others like it, but also learn more about the Java programming language.
These solutions should all be understandable to someone with two years of computer programming experience and a working knowledge of the Java language, but it does include a few solutions outside of the AP Computer Science A subset of the Java language.

## What code is included here?
Included in this repository are solutions to all of the problems, with helper classes, unit tests to each problem (whose name is the problem followed by StudentTest, and the official final tester which was used to grade all of the submissions to the competition.
There is also a re-implementation of the junit TestCase class that allows the testers to be run on computers which do not have junit installed. To use that, just run the appropriate test class as a java application (call the `main(String[] args)` method). If you have junit installed and would rather use junit, delete the junit folder and remove the main method from each tester.

## Who are you and why are you doing this?
My name is Jarred Allen. I went to Troy High School, graduated class of 2018, and I've competed in the Wittry competition all 4 years.
I put this code online and wrote these write-ups to lower the barrier to entry for this competition, which I believe to be a great experience for high school students interested in programming.

## Did you manage to do all of this during the competition?
No. My team (consisting of myself, Alexander Tsao, and Ahmed Abdalla, all Troy High School class of 2018) scored 94 points out of 114 in the competition. After the competition ended, I fixed the 20 points we were missing to have a complete set of solutions.
